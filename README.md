### Introduction

The **Rural Electrification Programme** in Kenya aimed to achieve universal electricity access nationwide, enabling about **76%** of Kenyan households to gain access to electricity. This initiative played a crucial role in strengthening rural economic resilience by providing households and businesses with reliable energy access, creating opportunities for income-generating activities, enhancing productivity, and supporting essential services such as education and healthcare. It also spurred the growth of small and medium enterprises, facilitated agricultural value addition, and improved the overall quality of life, thereby reducing economic vulnerabilities in rural areas. However, since the programme's conclusion in 2022, the country has experienced a significant decline in electricity access, particularly in terms of generation capacity and reliability.

Private sector investments in demand-driven and reliable generation technologies are crucial for enhancing electricity generation capacity to meet the country’s growing demand. In alignment with the World Bank and African Development Bank's **Mission 300**—which aims to provide electricity access to 300 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2030—this project leverages geospatial insights to inform energy planning and distribution in Kenya. This will scale up connectivity, which is a fundamental in addressing the country’s persistent development needs.

### Problem Statement

Economic planning across all sectors, including electricity and energy access, has not kept pace with Kenya's rapid population growth. As a result, the country currently faces a youth unemployment rate of about 67%, according to the Federation of Kenya Employers (FKE). Furthermore, an estimated 4.4% annual rural-to-urban migration, primarily driven by unemployed youth seeking work, often results in unstable or nonexistent employment opportunities for this demographic.

So, what long-term economic investments should the **Government of Kenya** prioritize, in collaboration with the **private sector** and **multilateral development institutions**, to effectively address the multifaceted challenges posed by the country’s rapidly growing population?

One key priority is **rural electrification and the expansion of energy access**, which will stimulate local investments, promote the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and enhance agricultural productivity through the adoption of advanced technologies. Most importantly, rural electrification will foster job creation in rural areas, drive sustained economic growth, increase household incomes, and strengthen the resilience of rural economies.


### Objective

This project utilizes geospatial data for Kenya to support strategic objectives in wind renewable energy planning.

**Classification and clustering algorithms** were applied to identify areas with sparse grid infrastructure and high population density, to highlight regions where wind farms and wind microgrids could be feasible solutions. 

**Findings:**

The machine learning analysis identified regions suitable for microgrids to be relatively densely populated, with an average of approximately 95.19 people per square kilometer. These areas also experience slightly stronger wind conditions, with an average speed of 6.14 m/s at 100 meters above ground level, making them well-suited for wind farms and microgrid installations.

Grid infrastructures in these regions were found to be significantly limited. Given the region's population density, there is clearly a higher demand for electricity but limited transmission capacity.

Approximately 50% of the population lives below the $2.15 poverty line, highlighting the high likelihood of rural-to-urban migration and the urgent need for economic empowerment.

### Recommendations

The **government of Kenya** in collaboration with the **private sector** should adopt this deployment model as a strategic guide for the placement of wind farms and microgrids. This approach will enhance energy and electricity access, promote sustainable development, and strengthen the economic resilience of rural communities.
