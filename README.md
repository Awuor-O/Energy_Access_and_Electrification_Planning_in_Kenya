### Introduction

The **Rural Electrification Programme** in Kenya aimed to achieve universal electricity access nationwide, enabling about **76%** of Kenyan households to gain access to electricity. This initiative played a crucial role in strengthening rural economic resilience by providing households and businesses with reliable energy access, creating opportunities for income-generating activities, enhancing productivity, and supporting essential services such as education and healthcare. It also spurred the growth of small and medium enterprises, facilitated agricultural value addition, and improved the overall quality of life, thereby reducing economic vulnerabilities in rural areas. However, since the programme's conclusion in 2022, the country has experienced a significant decline in electricity access, particularly in terms of generation capacity and reliability.

Private sector investments in demand-driven and reliable generation technologies are crucial for enhancing electricity generation capacity to meet the country’s growing demand. In alignment with the World Bank and African Development Bank's **[Mission 300](https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/energizing-africa#:~:text=Mission%20300%3A%20Providing%20Access%20to,improving%20education%20and%20health%20services.)**—which aims to provide electricity access to 300 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2030—this project leverages geospatial insights to inform energy planning and distribution in Kenya. This will scale up connectivity, which is a fundamental in addressing the country’s persistent development needs.

### Problem Statement

Economic planning across all sectors, including electricity and energy access, has not kept pace with Kenya's rapid population growth. As a result, the country currently faces a [youth unemployment rate of about 67%](https://www.fke-kenya.org/policy-issues/youth-employment?utm_source=chatgpt.com). Furthermore, an estimated [4.4% annual rural-to-urban migration](https://kippra.or.ke/unlocking-rural-areas-to-curb-rural-urban-migration-among-youth-in-kenya/?utm_source=chatgpt.com), primarily driven by unemployed youth seeking work, often results in unstable or nonexistent employment opportunities for this demographic.

So, what long-term economic investments should the **Government of Kenya** prioritize, in collaboration with the **private sector** and **multilateral development institutions**, to effectively address the multifaceted challenges posed by the country’s rapidly growing population?

One key priority is **rural electrification and the expansion of energy access**, which will stimulate local investments, promote the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and enhance agricultural productivity through the adoption of advanced technologies. Most importantly, rural electrification will foster job creation in rural areas, drive sustained economic growth, increase household incomes, and strengthen the resilience of rural economies.


### Objective

This project leverages Kenya’s geospatial data on wind energy potential, income levels, population density, and grid infrastructure to strategically guide the placement of wind renewable energy installations and wind-powered microgrids for electricity generation and distribution across the country.

The project utilized **Classification and Clustering Deep Learning Algorithms** to identify locations suitable for wind farms or wind microgrid installations.

Ideal locations for wind renewable energy were those with sparse grid infrastructure, where electricity transmission is challenging due to limited grid coverage. These areas were further assessed for demand potential, determined by population density, to ensure that the generated energy would meet sufficient demand. Economic viability was also a key consideration, with average income levels of the target population factored in to ensure profitability that will attract private sector investments. Finally, high wind speeds, measured in meters per second (m/s), were crucial for efficient wind energy generation and were included as a primary criterion in the algorithms. 

### Key Findings:

The algorithms classified regions into two distinct groups based on their **viability for wind renewable energy and wind-powered microgrid installations**.
Regions identified as viable for these installations exhibited the following characteristics:

* **Population density:** These areas are relatively densely populated, with an average of approximately **95.19 people per square kilometer**.

* **Wind conditions:** Wind speeds in these regions are slightly stronger, averaging **6.14 m/s at 100 meters above ground level**. This makes them suitable for both wind renewable energy and wind microgrid installations.

* **Grid infrastructure:** The grid infrastructure is significantly limited, with an index value of **0.000096**. Despite this limitation, the population density indicates high electricity demand, but the lack of transmission capacity underscores the need for decentralized energy solutions. These areas are most likely located in rural parts of the country.

* **Economic considerations:** The average income distribution shows that approximately **42% of the population lives below the $2.15 poverty line**, while about 48% represents profitable demand. This economic balance makes the regions attractive for private sector investments.

### Recommendations

The **government of Kenya** in collaboration with the **private sector** should adopt this deployment model as a strategic guide for the placement of wind farms and microgrids. This approach will enhance energy and electricity access, promote sustainable development, and strengthen the economic resilience of rural communities.
