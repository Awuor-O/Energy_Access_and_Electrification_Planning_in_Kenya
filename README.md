### Introduction

The **Rural Electrification Programme** in Kenya aimed to achieve universal electricity access nationwide, enabling about **76%** of Kenyan households to gain access to electricity. This initiative played a crucial role in strengthening rural economic resilience by providing households and businesses with reliable energy access, creating opportunities for income-generating activities, enhancing productivity, and supporting essential services such as education and healthcare. It also spurred the growth of small and medium enterprises, facilitated agricultural value addition, and improved the overall quality of life, thereby reducing economic vulnerabilities in rural areas. However, since the programme's conclusion in 2022, the country has experienced a significant decline in electricity access, particularly in terms of generation capacity and reliability.

Private sector investments in demand-based and reliable generation technologies are crucial for enhancing electricity generation capacity to meet the country’s growing demand. In alignment with the World Bank and African Development Bank's **Mission 300**—which aims to provide electricity access to 300 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa by 2030—this project leverages geospatial insights to guide energy planning and distribution in Kenya. This will scale up connectivity, which is a fundamental in addressing the country’s persistent development needs.

### Problem Statement

Kenya’s population has been steadily increasing over the years. Notably, economic planning has not kept pace with this rapid growth.  As a result, an annual estimate of 4.4% rural-urban migration occurs, driven largely by youth seeking employment. However, this migration may not yield stable opportunities, as the Federation of Kenya Employers (FKE) reports a high youth unemployment rate of 67%.

To address the challenges posed by Kenya’s growing population, rising unemployment, and high rates of rural-to-urban migration, the government must implement strategic, long-term economic interventions. 

Prioritizing rural electrification and expanding energy access will stimulate local investments, promote the growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and enhance agricultural productivity through the adoption of advanced technologies. Most critically, fostering job creation within rural areas will drive sustained economic growth, increase household income, and build resilience within rural economies.


### Objective

This project utilizes geospatial data for Kenya to support strategic objectives in wind renewable energy planning.

**Classification and clustering algorithms** were applied to identify areas with sparse grid infrastructure and high population density, to highlight regions where wind farms and wind microgrids could be feasible solutions. 

**Findings:**

The machine learning analysis identified regions suitable for microgrids to be relatively densely populated, with an average of approximately 95.19 people per square kilometer. These areas also experience slightly stronger wind conditions, with an average speed of 6.14 m/s at 100 meters above ground level, making them well-suited for wind farms and microgrid installations.

Grid infrastructures in these regions were found to be significantly limited. Given the region's population density, there is clearly a higher demand for electricity but limited transmission capacity.

Approximately 50% of the population lives below the $2.15 poverty line, highlighting the high likelihood of rural-to-urban migration and the urgent need for economic empowerment.

### Recommendations

The **government of Kenya** in collaboration with the **private sector** should adopt this deployment model as a strategic guide for the placement of wind farms and microgrids. This approach will enhance energy and electricity access, promote sustainable development, and strengthen the economic resilience of rural communities.
